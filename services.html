        <h3>Cloud Security & Compliance Audits</h3>
        <p>We perform comprehensive audits of your cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Microsoft 365) to ensure configurations follow best practices and compliance standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and CMMC. Audits include IAM reviews, security baseline checks, logging validation, and remediation roadmaps.</p>
